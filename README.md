To use, first install all the dependancies in your kernel using the following commands.

#### pip install transformers
#### pip install pytest-shutil
#### pip install textract

You can also install them using the wheels provided in this repository. Just download the repository and run the following commands in your terminal.

#### pip install Wheels/pytest-shutil/*.whl
#### pip install Wheels/textract/*.whl
#### pip install Wheels/transformers/*.whl

Internet Connection is a must for the model to be loaded. Github doesn't allow uploading files over 100MB, so I couldn't upload the model here. The [model](https://huggingface.co/kabir5297/ResumeClassificationNew/tree/main) is in huggingface.
